Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `t` _is an anagram of_ `s`_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**
**Input:** s = "rat", t = "car"
**Output:** false
